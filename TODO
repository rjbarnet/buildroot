Steps:
 * Depend on extract step
 * rsync from build directory
    * Could extraction steps be done in this new directory instead of
      having to use the build directory?
        * issue with using build dir is that it could have already built
 * create blank git repo with the source there
 * add all extracted source to the git repo
    * commit with basic commit message saying it is the initial commit
 * apply patches
    * put file path in the patch before apply
    * how to handle patches which don't conform to git patch style



* Put path of each patch file into commit message before applying the patch
   ** Remove after applying the patch
* How to handle adding new patches?
   ** Do you put in the directory of the last patch?
   ** Is there some sort of key placement/etc that should be used?
